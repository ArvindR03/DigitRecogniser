# Digit Recogniser with Inbuilt Pygame GUI

## Summary
This is a neural network that has been trained using the attached Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab resources, on the MNIST Digits dataset, to be used to categorise digits that can be drawn in a Paint-style GUI made with Pygame. The GUI will call on the model and print the recognised digit in the terminal.
